 - Here you will find a bunch of PHP files. The home page is index.php and from there you can
   navigate using your browser through the entire web page.
 - You will also find a DATABASE_SQL_FILE.sql file. You can just import this to my SQL.
 - The config.php file contains the login information for the database. Once you set up
   a database (and import the SQL file), change the config file to fit the servername, username, password, etc.

To see how to run this:
    *See the Example_WebsiteSetup directory which was provided by the professor. It just gives a simple
     example database and a README file on how to get started.

In summary:
    1. Install AppServ
    2. Install NetBeans for PHP
    3. Create a PHP project in netbeans and put it in the www directory inside the AppServ
       directory which AppServ creates in your root directory.
    3. Put all these project files in that project directory.
    4. If you run it from NetBeans it will open a browser and run.
